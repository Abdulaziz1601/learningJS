// null and undefined both mean that there is no value to access

console.log(null == undefined);
console.log(null === undefined);

// Only difference between Null and Undefined
// Is the INTENT that programmers is gonna show us
// using the keyword null or undefined

// null specifically tells us that this variable has no value 

// undefined says, It has not been defined yet

let a;

console.log(a); // undefined - tells us to actually defined it and use it

// However defining smth with null, tells us that variable was defined but It has no value at all
